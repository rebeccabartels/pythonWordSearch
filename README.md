# pythonWordSearch
#You are given a text file, and in your WordSearch.py file, create a function called wordSearch() which will take in a string as a parameter and will carry out the following tasks.
#Opens up and reads the text contained within “Monologue.txt”
#Searches through the text in order to uncover whether the string passed into wordSearch() can be found.
#Prints out how many times the string passed can be found within the original text.
#Hints:
#Whenever string.split() is used to discover how many instances of a string appear within a block of text, the length of the list returned by the method is always one greater than it should be.
#Remember that you have to call a function in order to use it. Defining a function is never enough.
#The script file where you will write your solution has comments that guide you step by step through the code you will need to write.
